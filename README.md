Overview of this project 

Project Name: Password Strength Checker

Objective: Develop a tool to assess the strength of passwords entered by users, providing feedback on factors such as length, complexity, and uniqueness.

Features:

1. Password Length Check: Ensures password is at least 8 characters long.
2. Character Complexity Check: Verifies password contains a mix of:
    - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
    - Lowercase letters (a-z)
    - Numbers (0-9)
    - Special characters (!, @, #, $, etc.)
3. Uniqueness Check: Detects:
    - Sequential characters (e.g., "abc", "123")
    - Repeating characters (e.g., "aaa", "111")
4. Password Strength Categorization: Classifies password strength as:
    - Strong (no errors)
    - Medium (1-2 errors)
    - Weak (3 or more errors)
5. Error Feedback: Provides specific error messages for each failed check.

Implementation:

- Python programming language
- Regular expressions (re module) for pattern matching
- Input/Output operations for user interaction

Benefits:

- Helps users create stronger passwords
- Provides clear feedback on password weaknesses
- Can be integrated into password registration or change processes

This project focuses on developing a comprehensive password strength checker tool, offering users actionable feedback to improve their password security.
